# Rectangle Drawing React Frontend

This is a small React frontend application that allows users to draw and resize a rectangle SVG with real-time validation using a backend API. The application interacts with a .NET Core backend for validation and persistence of the rectangleâ€™s dimensions.

## Features

- SVG Rectangle Drawing: Dynamically render and display a rectangle SVG based on dimensions.
- Resize Functionality: Users can input new dimensions (width and height) to resize the rectangle.
- Perimeter Calculation: Automatically calculates and displays the perimeter of the rectangle.
- Backend Validation: Ensures the rectangle's width does not exceed its height by sending the data to a backend API for validation.
- Error Handling: Shows error messages in a modal when validation fails.
- Asynchronous Validation: Allows users to make changes while previous validation is still in progress, imitating long backend processing (10-second delay).

## Technologies and Concepts Used

- React (Frontend)
- TypeScript for strong typing.
- Axios for HTTP requests to interact with the backend API.
- React JSX.
- CSS for styling.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlinHoxha/rectangle-drawing-react-frontend.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd rectangle-drawing-react-frontend
```
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
The Rectangle directory is already assigned on the App.tsx file, so the browser will directly display the Rectangle page.
